Example Data Portfolio using Python

# [Project 1 :  Project Machine Learning with Python Building Recommender System (DQLAB)](https://github.com/FirzaCank/Firza_Portfolio/tree/main/Project%201)
This example project i built recommender system especially for movie that watcher can filtering according to the category that watcher wants. This project details are:
- Created Weighted rating function for movie
- Created Simple User Prefer Recommender with adult category, start year, and genres parameters for movie

# [Project 2 : Project Machine Learning with Python Building Recommender System with Similarity Function (DQLAB)](https://github.com/FirzaCank/Firza_Portfolio/tree/main/Project%202)
This example project i built recommender system with similarity function for movie to give a list of movies that are similar to the last movie you watched. This project details are:
- Apply CountVectorizer to convert a collection of text documents to a matrix of token counts.
- Create similarity model between the count matrix (application of CountVectorizer) to calculate similarity score using cosine similarity.
- Presenting results of list of movies that contain recommendations for the most similar the name of the movie that has been inputted.
